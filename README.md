Professional Data Science Report on SQL Server Audit Data Analysis
1. Introduction
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of SQL Server audit data using Python, specifically leveraging the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization. The data contains records of various activities and events that occurred on the server, providing insights into user behavior, event distribution, and the performance of database operations.

2. Data Overview
The dataset consists of 7,920 entries and 41 columns. It includes various attributes such as event_time, sequence_number, action_id, succeeded, session_id, client_ip, and more. Below is a brief overview of the dataset:

Total Entries: 7,920
Total Columns: 41
Missing Data: Some columns, like permission_bitmask, target_server_principal_name, and data_sensitivity_information, contain a significant amount of missing data, which may impact certain analyses.
Data Sample
Here is a snapshot of the first five rows of the dataset:

event_time	sequence_number	action_id	succeeded	permission_bitmask	session_id	client_ip	duration_milliseconds
2024-08-17 06:31:57.367	1	AUSC	True	NaN	9	Unknown	0
2024-08-17 06:37:18.042	1	SL	True	NaN	59	local machine	0
2024-08-17 06:37:18.326	1	SL	True	NaN	59	local machine	0
2024-08-17 06:37:18.326	1	SL	True	NaN	59	local machine	0
2024-08-17 06:37:18.326	1	SL	True	NaN	59	local machine	0
Descriptive Statistics
A general statistical summary of key numeric fields is provided below:

sequence_number: Mean = 1.059, Std = 0.247, Min = 1, Max = 3
session_id: Mean = 59.282, Std = 6.145, Min = 9, Max = 89
duration_milliseconds: Mean = 0, Std = 0, Min = 0, Max = 0
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Given the presence of missing values in certain columns, a cleaning process was performed:

Missing Values: Rows with missing values in critical columns (session_server_principal_name, action_id) were dropped to ensure the integrity of subsequent analyses.
Datetime Conversion: The event_time column was converted to a datetime format and set as the index for time-based analyses.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
4.1 Distribution of Events Over Time
To understand how events are distributed over time, a time series plot was created, showing the number of events per hour.

python
نسخ الكود
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
audit_data['sequence_number'].resample('H').count().plot()
plt.title('Distribution of Events Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Number of Events')
plt.show()
This plot helps identify peak activity periods, which could be crucial for capacity planning and understanding server load.

4.2 User Activity Analysis
User behavior was analyzed by grouping the data by session_server_principal_name and action_id, counting the number of successful and failed actions.

python
نسخ الكود
user_activity = df_cleaned.groupby(['session_server_principal_name', 'action_id'])['succeeded'].value_counts().unstack().fillna(0)
print(user_activity)
This analysis revealed the actions performed by different users, allowing us to identify any unusual or unauthorized activities.

4.3 Success Rate Analysis
The overall success rate of actions was calculated to gauge the effectiveness of operations.

python
نسخ الكود
success_rate = df['succeeded'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print("Success Rate:")
print(success_rate)
Given that all operations were successful (100% success rate), attention should be given to whether this reflects the true state of the system or if there is a reporting issue.

4.4 Duration Analysis
The distribution of duration_milliseconds was analyzed to understand the performance of different operations. High-duration operations were flagged for further investigation.

python
نسخ الكود
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(df['duration_milliseconds'], bins=50, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Distribution of Duration (milliseconds)')
plt.xlabel('Duration (milliseconds)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

high_duration_operations = df[df['duration_milliseconds'] > df['duration_milliseconds'].quantile(0.95)]
print("High duration operations:")
print(high_duration_operations[['session_id', 'duration_milliseconds', 'action_id']])
This analysis is crucial for performance optimization and identifying bottlenecks in the system.

5. Correlation Analysis
The relationship between different variables was explored to identify any significant correlations that could inform further analysis or predictive modeling.

succeeded vs action_id: A cross-tabulation was performed to analyze the success rate across different actions.
session_id vs duration_milliseconds: The mean duration per session was calculated to identify sessions with unusually long durations.
6. Conclusion
The analysis provided insights into the distribution of events over time, user behavior, and system performance. The following recommendations are made based on the findings:

Monitoring High-Activity Periods: Consider increasing server capacity or optimizing queries during peak hours.
Investigating High-Duration Operations: Analyze and optimize operations that take significantly longer to complete.
Data Quality Improvement: Address the high percentage of missing values in critical columns to improve the reliability of future analyses.
This report serves as a starting point for more detailed investigations, including predictive analytics and anomaly detection, which could further enhance the security and efficiency of the SQL Server environment.
